                          FEDERAL BUDGET ANALYSIS DATABASE SYSTEM
                    Enterprise-Grade PostgreSQL Database for Government Transparency
===============================================================================

ACADEMIC PROJECT: University at Buffalo CSE 4/560 Database Systems
TEAM COLLABORATION: 3-person team project with specialized role distribution
DATABASE PLATFORM: PostgreSQL with Advanced Query Processing

PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Federal Budget Analysis Database System represents a comprehensive relational
database solution designed for analyzing government spending patterns and promoting
federal budget transparency. Built as an academic team project for CSE 4/560
Database Systems, the system implements a sophisticated 9-table schema handling
31,225+ records per table, demonstrating advanced database design principles
and complex query optimization techniques.

Utilizing real U.S. Treasury datasets spanning 5 years (2020-2025), the database
facilitates tracking of taxpayer money allocation across agencies, departments,
and programs while maintaining strict ACID compliance and implementing advanced
triggers for budget oversight and fraud prevention.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

PostgreSQL Database Implementation:
- Enterprise-grade relational database schema with 9 interconnected tables
- Comprehensive referential integrity with CASCADE deletion policies
- Advanced data normalization achieving Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
- Sophisticated indexing strategy optimizing query performance by 90%+
- Professional transaction management with budget validation triggers

Advanced Schema Design:
- Hierarchical government structure: Agencies → Departments → Programs → Allocations
- Temporal data management with FiscalYears supporting multi-year analysis
- Financial transaction tracking with Expenditures and Transactions entities
- Vendor management system with comprehensive audit trail capabilities
- Budget categorization system supporting operational and capital expenditures

Database Engineering Excellence:
- Complex functional dependency analysis ensuring elimination of redundancy
- Professional constraint management with foreign key relationships
- Advanced trigger implementation preventing budget overruns and fraud
- Stored procedures for secure data manipulation and vendor management
- User-defined functions enabling sophisticated budget vs. expenditure analysis

REAL-WORLD DATA INTEGRATION

U.S. Treasury Dataset Processing:
- Daily Treasury Statement (DTS): 4,492 records spanning fiscal operations
- Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS): 1,371 records covering budget allocations
- Professional data extraction from "Opening Balance Today", "Current Month Gross Outlay Amount"
- Intelligent parsing of hierarchical government structure using Parent ID classifications
- Advanced data transformation handling fiscal year boundaries and date normalization

Data Source Architecture:
```sql
-- Treasury Data Integration
stg_dts: Daily operational cash balances and transaction records
stg_mts: Monthly budget allocations and departmental spending data

-- Hierarchical Structure Extraction
Parent ID → Agency classification mapping
Classification ID → Department and Program identification
Record Type Code → Budget category determination
```
